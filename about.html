I am a B.Tech Computer Science and Engineering student with a strong interest in programming and emerging technologies. My academic journey has equipped me with solid knowledge in data structures, algorithms, and software development. I am proficient in languages like Python, C++, and Java, and I enjoy building projects that solve real-world problems. My areas of interest include machine learning, web development, and artificial intelligence. I actively take part in coding challenges, hackathons, and tech events to improve my skills. Learning new tools and frameworks is something I find exciting and rewarding. I also enjoy working in teams and collaborating on technical projects. Time management and logical thinking are among my key strengths. Outside of academics, I like reading tech blogs, listening to music, and exploring productivity tools. I aspire to become a software engineer and contribute to meaningful tech innovations. I am currently looking for internship opportunities to gain hands-on industry experience. My goal is to grow into a responsible and skilled professional in the tech field.
